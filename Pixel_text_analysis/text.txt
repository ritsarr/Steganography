It can be a good theme to work on in the future. We can analyze text by imagining their letters as a pixels. 
Human texts (according to the frequency analysis I guess) have a lot of same pixels, which are representing the most "popular" letter. 
Also they are quite chaotic, really look like a noise. At the same time files with the code or .exe files look way more structured.
So, it is possible to do some visual analysis, using the technique of 8 bits of char == 8 bits of pixel color. 
However, we are coding three letters for 1 pixel, so it will be better to use 1 for 1, and then the upper thesis will be correct.
