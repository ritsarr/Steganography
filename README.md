This code hides secret data (text or image) in BMP files by changing the least significant bits of pixels. 
It reads a BMP image, embeds the data, and saves a new image with the hidden information. 
Secret data can also be extracted from the modified image.

Just a realization of one of my labaratory works in Polytech university. The main goal was to nake an encrypter (void hide()) and a decrypter(void unhide()) for some information 
(especially text in this version, of courese you can hide anu bytes, but for example I couldn't run the .exe file)

In the future version it should paste into the image information about the type and the size of the encrypted file
